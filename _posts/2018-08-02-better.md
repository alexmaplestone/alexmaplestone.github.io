  <h2>Better Than Who?</h2>

  <p>
    There is always going to be someone better or worse than you at a given 
    pursuit.
	 Someone is always going to learn faster or slower than you, be stronger 
	 or weaker than you, and work harder or slack off more than you.
	 Even if you are at the top (or bottom) of your field now, give it a year 
	 or fifty and someone will overtake you.
	 Therefore, <strong>it is useless to compare yourself to others</strong>, 
	 to justify your failures with “but they’re smarter than me,” and your 
	 successes with “but I work harder than them.”
	 A healthy dose of friendly competition can be motivating, but the 
	 comparative mindset that so many of us operate with is damaging to our 
	 growth.
	 You lose sight of your own journey and instead fight to stay ahead of 
	 everyone, leaving the validation of your worthiness to others who may not 
	 care. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>This is not meant to be disheartening, but liberating</strong>.
	 By asking yourself the right questions, you gain a clearer sense of your 
	 strengths and weaknesses, learn more from your mistakes, and better 
	 appreciate your accomplishments – you can supercharge your growth. 
	 So ask yourself: <strong>are you better than you were before?</strong>
