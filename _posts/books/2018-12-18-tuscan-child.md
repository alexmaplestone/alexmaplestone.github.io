Rhys Bowen writes with vivid imagery, and I was transported to a little village nestled in the Tuscan hills. Her imagery goes beyond sights and sounds to include the tastes and smells of rich Tuscan food (I mean, it’s Italy—writing about the food is almost obligatory). The interwoven narratives create suspense and mystery that compelled me to keep reading, while also exploring the effects of inter-generational trauma.<!--more-->

It could have been better, though. [Elmore Leonard,](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/elmore-leonard-and-the-rules-of-writing/article13889666/) author of 40 novels, said of exclamation marks: “You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose.” I agree. While Bowen didn’t use a copious amount of exclamation marks (I counted about five), the book would have read better without them.    

Despite being written in first person, I felt as though I wasn’t able to connect fully with the protagonists. The book had emotional moments, but I felt as if I were removed, instead of inside the character's head. Maybe this was intentional, as the protagonists were both British and somewhat proper, and so to write with full emotion would have broken character. Or maybe I am so used to hearing things said straight that I can't decipher indirect British sentences.
  
While Bowen shows rather than tells, she still over-explains. I was disappointed that there were no narrative gaps to fill, no actions to interpret. You get what you put into something, and I got less out of this novel than I would have liked. 

Nonetheless, this was an engaging read, and definitely for fans of historical and war-time fiction.
