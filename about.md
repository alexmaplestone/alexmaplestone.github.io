Welcome. This is where I share my musings on how to create and live with intention. I hope you find them useful.

### Influences

Everything from my writing style to the layout of this blog is influenced by great bloggers such as [Derek Sivers,](https://sivers.org/) [Cal Newport,](http://calnewport.com/blog/) [The Minimalists,](https://www.theminimalists.com/) and [Seth Godin.](https://seths.blog/) If you know of any other great bloggers, especially women and memebers of minorites, I'd love to hear your recommendations in the comments (coming soon).
