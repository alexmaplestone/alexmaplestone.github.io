  <h2>Reading</h2>
  <p>
    A snapshot of what I've been reading lately.
    I've taken the design from <a href="https://sivers.org/book">Derek Siver's</a> (a prolific blogger and reader) "Books I've Read" page, and tweaked it to fit my style.
    You can read full reviews and book notes under "More Details".

  <h3>A Note on Notes</h3>
  <p>
    My notes are not a summary.
    They are de-contextualized snippets of information to help me remember what Iâ€™ve learned.
    If you enjoy reading them too, great!
    Go read the book.
